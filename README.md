<p align="center">
  A "modern" clone to the 360 Lizard. 
</p>

# Why bother cloning this?

Mostly for preservations sake, but it really annoyed me having to deal with Windows 10/11 and driver issues, old LTU pcb's getting stuck on "writing .", JungleFlasher using very suspicious remote execution dll's (I'll be going into the software side later in the docs), the clutter of having to having cables all over the place/pc needing to be open to get access to a SATA plug. List goes on.
